# Squid-Game
Squid-Game OOP ACS
For the winter break we had to recreate the Squid Game (a Netflix show very popular at that time) using the knowledge accumulated across the semester at OOP (Object-oriented programming). You can find the requirements in the pdf “Cerinta Proiect Laborator POO 2021”. The pdf is in Romanian.
In “Data.txt” you can find the names of the fictional characters that took part in the game. “test1 ss1.png”, “test1 ss2.png”, “test2 ss1.png”, “test1 ss2.png” are the result of 2 different runs of the program, “main.cpp” is the source program and “main.exe” the executable.
